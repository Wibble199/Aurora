    <!-- This template is used as the template for ComboBoxes and ListViews when the UseLocalizedItemTemplate property
         is set to true. It is designed for use with the EnumToItemsSource Markup Extension and simply displays a
         textblock bound to the localization key and package which are given by a LocalizedDescriptionAttribute on an
         enum member. This allows for the possibility of opt-in localization for itemssources which still react to the
         TranslationSource's culture being changed. -->
